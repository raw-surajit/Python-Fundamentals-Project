Python Mastery: Fundamentals, Databases & Data Science 🐍☕
This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of my journey through the Python ecosystem. It transitions from core programming logic to professional database management and interactive data exploration.

🚀 The Learning Roadmap
1. Core Python Engineering
Logic & Control: Mastery of Conditionals, Loops, and Functions to solve complex engineering problems.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Building modular, reusable code using classes and inheritance.

Advanced Mechanics: Implementation of Decorators, Scopes, and robust Error Handling.

2. Data Science & Interactive Analysis
Jupyter Notebooks: Using .ipynb environments for interactive coding, data visualization, and step-by-step experimentation.

Environment Management: Utilizing Anaconda and Conda to manage data science dependencies and isolated environments.

3. The "YouTube Manager" Project Series
A progression of data persistence strategies:

Phase 1: Local Files: Storing video metadata in standard text files (youtube.txt).

Phase 2: SQL Integration: Transitioning to structured relational data with SQLite3.

Phase 3: Cloud NoSQL: The final professional implementation using MongoDB Atlas for scalable, cloud-based storage.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.12+

Databases: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud), SQLite3 (Local)

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Anaconda, Git/GitHub

Key Libraries: pymongo, python-dotenv, requests

🔧 Installation & Security
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repo: git clone https://github.com/raw-surajit/Python-Fundamentals-Project.git

Install Requirements: pip install pymongo[srv] python-dotenv

Environment Variables: Create a .env file for your database credentials.

Security Best Practices
This project follows professional security standards by:

Using .gitignore to prevent sensitive files (like .env and __pycache__) from being public.

Implementing Environment Variables to protect database connection strings.
